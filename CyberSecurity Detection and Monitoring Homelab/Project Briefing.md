# This Project

This is a personal project for my field of interest, which is network security and blue team activity. 

The functional **Cyber security Home Lab** created in this project will be use for testing offensive and defensive security activity.

My purpose for this lab is to learn more about **security Monitoring and Detection**.

# Requirements

**This lab will require**:

~ **Virtual Machines**: including offensive machine and potential linux machines that can be added to the network for exploitation

~ **PfSense**: this will be the firewall for controlling inbound and outbound traffic.

~ **Splunk**: This is an additional SIEM that will be for this project.

~ **Security Onion**: This will be the IDS, Security Monitoring and Log Management solution for the project.
